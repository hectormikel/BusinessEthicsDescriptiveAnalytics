Ethical Decision-Making in Organisational Contexts
Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a study investigating the dynamics of ethical decision-making within organisational settings. The research focuses on the interplay of personal, organisational, and external factors, including leadership behaviors, workplace culture, the impact of artificial intelligence, and the effects of COVID-19 on ethical practices. The analysis leverages data from the IBE (Institute of Business Ethics) survey to derive insights into ethical behavior and its determinants.

Key Features

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Rigorous preprocessing of survey data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Ethics Index (ethics_index): A weighted metric developed to assess respondents' ethical leanings.
Ethics Classifier (is_ethical): A Boolean classifier to categorize respondents based on their ethical behavior.
Exploratory Analysis: Insights into the role of ethical leadership, workplace culture, and external factors in shaping ethical practices.
Outlier Analysis: Examination of how outliers can influence data trends and potentially lead to misleading conclusions.
Systemic Challenges: Identification of critical issues such as workplace bias, data privacy concerns, and environmental sustainability that impact organisational integrity.
Findings

Ethical Leadership: Strong evidence highlights the pivotal role of ethical leadership in fostering an ethical organisational culture.
Work Environment: The workplace setting can either reinforce or undermine ethical practices, depending on its structure and dynamics.
Outliers and Data Integrity: Outliers can significantly affect data central tendencies and spread, necessitating careful analysis to avoid erroneous conclusions.
Systemic Challenges: Addressing workplace bias, data privacy, and environmental concerns is crucial for maintaining organisational trust and integrity.
Limitations

Data Quality and Availability: Challenges related to data completeness and potential biases in survey responses.
Latent Biases: Recognition of inherent biases that may influence the interpretation of results.
Future Work

Machine Learning Models: Exploration of predictive models to identify key variables influencing ethical behavior.
Hypothesis-Driven Testing: Conducting targeted experiments to validate findings and refine understanding.
Survey Improvement: Enhancing survey questions and methodologies for future data collection, if feasible.
